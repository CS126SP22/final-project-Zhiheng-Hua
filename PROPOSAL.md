# Final Project Proposal


## Project Desctiption

- This will be a machine learning project about indoor scenes image classification and data analysis visualization
- The project will be developed using C++ and the library Cinder
- Dataset used: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsahmad/indoor-scenes-cvpr-2019`

## Motivation & Background Knowlege
- Motivation: Cinder is a library with nice graphic support, so a project about image processing and analyzing will be a great option for the final project. Image classification is a widely discussed field in machine learning and deep learning, so it will be a nice experience to work on a project about that.
- Background knowledge required:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Algorithm
  - loading and parsing images using Cinder, reference: `https://mottosso.gitbooks.io/cinder/content/book/cinder/Surface.html`

## Timeline
- week1: load, parse, and store image, error detection and testing
- week2: implement CNN algorithm, model training and storing, testing
- week3: develop a easy-to-use GUI for user to upload image and make classification predictions with results shown on screen
- week4: prediction analysis and visualization and testing
